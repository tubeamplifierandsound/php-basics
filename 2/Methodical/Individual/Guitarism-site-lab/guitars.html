                            <h3>Fender Stratocaster</h3>
                            <img src="img/guitars/stratocaster.jpg"> 
                            <p>Outside of the Gibson Les Paul Standard, no electric guitar says rock-and-roll 
                                like the dual-horned Fender Stratocaster. It could be the most easily-recognized 
                                and widely-played electric guitar in the world, by pros and amateurs alike. 
                                Exactly how ironic is this ax? Well, Jimi Hendrix set fire to it, Eric Clapton 
                                bought six at once, Stevie Ray Vaughn singlehandedly resurrected blues with it, 
                                and Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour owns serial number #0001.

                            <p>One of two of the most recognized electric guitars in the world 
                                along with Fender’s Stratocaster, the Gibson Les Paul Standard 
                                has been THE electric guitar for generations of rock-and-rollers. 
                                There’s nothing quite like the universal appeal of the Standard’s 
                                beautiful, simple design and smooth lines. After all, it’s not 
                                called the Standard for anything.

                            <img src="img/guitars/sg.jpg">
                            <p>The best-selling Gibson guitar of all time, the SG (officially renamed 
                                the SG Standard in 1963) was originally intended as a redesign of the 
                                Les Paul Standard. When the SG hit in 1961, it sold more than three 
                                times the number of Les Paul Standards sold in the guitar’s entire 
                                three-year run from 1958–60. Maybe that’s because the SG looks as 
                                hard as it rocks.

                            <p>Originally introduced as the Broadcaster, the Telecaster, or Tele, 
                                hasn’t evolved much over the years, and with good reason. After all, 
                                when you’re the revolutionary model that finally put solid-body 
                                electric guitars on the map and started the rock-and-roll lead guitar 
                                phenomenon, what exactly do you need to improve on? The original’s 
                                simple design and fluid lines have been retained throughout the 
                                Tele’s production, which has gone uninterrupted since its debut 
                                over 60 years ago.

                            <p>The Gibson Explorer is a type of electric guitar model by Gibson guitars. 
                                The Explorer offered a radical, "futuristic" body design. The Explorer was 
                                the final development of a prototype design that, years later, Gibson 
                                marketed under the name Futura.The Explorer became especially popular 
                                among the hard rock and heavy metal musicians of the 1970s and 1980s.
